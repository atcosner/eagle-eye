===============================

This project is solution for the [Univeristy of Kansas Biodiviersity Institute](https://biodiversity.ku.edu/) to allow for the automaic OCR and digitization of paper collection forms.
While testing and development was done for specific KU form templates this project could be adapted to other forms allowing for its use for other museum collections.
Optical Character Recognition is by the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision?hl=en) but swapping for other handwriting recognition models is supported.
