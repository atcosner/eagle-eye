## Future Ideas
* Results Page
  * Options for 'Field-by-Field' and 'Whole Page' (Show each ROI vs show the whole page)

## Links
* https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/66638/pretrained-handwritten-ocr-model

## Programming TODO
* Handle results exports in a dynamic format
  * Each result may want to export itself as N columns
  * Building up DF should ensure column uniqueness
* Remove the 'From Above' button from the tab order

## Things To Do
1. Handle 'Copy from previous' on certain fields (Only bottom of sheet)
2. Date validation (Fix/parse dates in different formats)
3. Break dates into 3 columns in the export
4. Whole-form mode (See whole image on the left)
5. Custom validation and format for certain fields
