<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
Eagle Eye was originally developed for the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute (KUBI) in 2024.

This project was tested on KU collection forms but the tool is designed to be dynamic and customizable.

I would like to thank Dr. Lucas DeCicco and Abby Perkins for their assistance and support in building this tool.
